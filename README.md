This application displays DIDSON and ARIS sonar files and allows the user to draw boxes around identified objects and label them.  The program will export all the annotated frames along with a JSON file containing the rectangle dimensions and annotation categories.  The intended purpose of these annotations is for use in developing machine learning models for identifying objects in the sonar files.  Compiled binaries for both Windows and Macs are available and the code can be compiled on Linux as well.
